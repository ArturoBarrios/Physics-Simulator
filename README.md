How to run program:

Run a live server. In atom, I just installed the live-server package. To use that you just need to click on View, Toggle 
command palette, and then type server to choose one of the live servers. Assuming you were in the correct directory,
you just need to click on cardboard.

To run the program just click browse and then choose "spin_proj_norm_vs_pos_p_v_z_2z.txt" On the upper right hand corner 
click on the show toggle to show the vectors.
